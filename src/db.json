      "description": "It is Christmas time and the McCallister family is preparing for a vacation in Paris, France. But the youngest in the family, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), got into a scuffle with his older brother Buzz (Devin Ratray) and was sent to his room, which is on the third floor of his house. Then, the next morning, while the rest of the family was in a rush to make it to the airport on time, they completely forgot about Kevin, who now has the house all to himself. Being home alone was fun for Kevin, having a pizza all to himself, jumping on his parents' bed, and making a mess. Then, Kevin discovers about two burglars, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), about to rob his house on Christmas Eve. Kevin acts quickly by wiring his own house with makeshift booby traps to stop the burglars and to bring them to justice."

      "description": "Superman takes to the skies once more as Henry Cavill dons the mantle of the Man of Steel -- wrestling with a past he can't comprehend and a future he cannot escape. With an all-star cast that includes Diane Lane and Kevin Costner as Clark's earthbound parents; OscarÂ® winner Russell Crowe as Superman's Kryptonian father; Amy Adams as Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane; Laurence Fishburne as editor Perry White; and Michael Shannon as Superman's otherworldly archenemy General Zod, the sky's the limit for the last son of Krypton. Alive with the directorial stylings of 300's Zack Snyder and the production team behind Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, Man of Steel offers up an entirely new Superman: alienated, misunderstood, but forever a beacon of hope for all humanity.",
